# FakeNewsML

## Overview
This project is an interactive tool that utilizes the Gmail API to fetch emails from the user's inbox and makes use of a custom machine learning algorithm to determine whether the content of the email is spam or not. The machine learning algorithm is implemented in Python using the TF-IDF word-vectorizer algorithm. The GUI is built with Flet UI in Python.
